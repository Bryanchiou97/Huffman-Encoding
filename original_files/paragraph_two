Instead of a static tree being identical for any type of data, a dynamic analysis of the probability distribution could take place. Codes generated from these code trees match the real conditions clearly better than standard distributions. The major disadvantage of this procedure is, that the information about the Huffman tree has to be embedded into the compressed files or data transmissions. A code table or the symbol's frequencies must be part of the header data. If thedynamic Huffman code is applied for the entire data set, internal variations would not be considered. A practical solution is the subdivision into segments andperiodical updates of the code tree. But the header size would increase due to these additional data.
